DBIx/Namespace version 0.03
===========================

One of the limitations of SQL is that the tables lie
within a flat namespace.  This module provides
a directory-like partitioning, allowing identical table
names to co-exist within the same database.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

    DBI, plus the DBD driver for the desired database

TESTING

The tests included automatically are trivial as any
serious testing requires a suitably configured database.
Within the 't' directory there is a file '01basic.pl'
which gives a little exercise to create, delete, select
and replace operations.  The top of the file holds
settings for database, user and password, which would need
editing first.
